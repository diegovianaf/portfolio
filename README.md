# Personal Portfolio

A responsive website to introduce myself and show my main projects.

## Features

- Hamburger Menu toggle (mobile screen)
- Smooth Scrolling
- Scroll Animation
- Contact Form
## Lessons Learned

My main challenge in this project was the mobile menu because when the menu was open, the scroll kept working, and when I opened and closed the menu, the page always went back to the top.

To fix that, I added a condition that added a class that applied `overflow-y: hidden;` and `position: relative;` to the `body` when opening the menu and removed it when closing the menu.

Besides that, I also created a function that when clicking on any link of the header, the body and nav classes are removed, avoiding issues.

With this project, I learned a lot about solving problems because there was always something to fix, and I could practice my knowledge about responsivity and accessibility.
